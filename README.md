# Timeless Artists Hub Server

## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend server for the **Timeless Artists Hub** project. It provides a RESTful API for managing a curated catalog of visual artists and their artworks using a relational PostgreSQL database. The server powers the frontend interface by handling requests, delivering filtered and paginated data, and managing database persistence.

Artworks are linked to artists through a one-to-many foreign key relationship, and the system uses cascading deletes to ensure clean data handling. The server also comes with setup and seeding scripts for fast deployment and development.

## Tech Stack

* **Runtime**: Node.js
* **Framework**: Express
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Deployment**: Render

## Features

* **RESTful Routing**: Consistent endpoints for managing artists and artworks.
* **Full CRUD Support**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for both resource types.
* **Relational Data Model**: PostgreSQL schema enforces one-to-many relationship via foreign keys.
* **Cascading Deletes**: When an artist is deleted, all their artworks are automatically removed.
* **Pre-Seeded Data**: Database comes preloaded with a curated list of artists and their artwork metadata.
* **Setup Scripts**: Includes SQL scripts for schema creation and database seeding.

## Database Schema

Two core tables are used:

* **artistes**: Stores artist data including name, nationality, birth/death years, genre, bios, and media links.
* **artworks**: Stores artwork data tied to artists, including style, title, image, and creation date.

```sql
CREATE TABLE artistes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  artiste_name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  birth_year INT,
  death_year INT,
  genre VARCHAR(50),
  nationality VARCHAR(35),
  bio TEXT,
  wikipedia_link TEXT,
  youtube_link TEXT,
  is_favorite BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE artworks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  artwork_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  artiste_name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  style VARCHAR(35),
  date_created VARCHAR(15),
  img_link TEXT,
  is_favorite BOOLEAN,
  artiste_id INTEGER REFERENCES artistes (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
